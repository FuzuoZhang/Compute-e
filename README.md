#### Compute e

---

**Introduction**

This project computes Euler's constant: e with high accuracy. You can specify the error-precision.

The project also is a homework for my course named Numerical Analysis and Algorithm.

**Content**

- The main algorithms to compute e

  - Optimal Approximation(or Taylor Expansion)

  ​      中文：最佳逼近（Taylor展开）

  - Numerical solution for ODE(Ordinary Differentical Equations)

  ​      中文：常微分方程数值求解

  - Numerical Integration & Equation Solving

  ​       中文：数值积分+方程求根

- Other difficulties for the project

I implement the computation with high precision.
